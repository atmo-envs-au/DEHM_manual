# The DEHM Manual

This is a manual for DEHM, the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model [(ref)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310%2897%2900264-1 "DEHM") developed at Aarhus Univeristy. The manual aim to equip new users with enough information to quickly get an overview of the workflow and the different versions (Hopefully) of the model.
